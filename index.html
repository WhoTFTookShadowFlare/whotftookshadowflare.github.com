		<h1>About me</h1>
		I am a developer who makes stupid little projects that are not always little (or stupid). <br>
		All of my projects can be found in a list <a href="projects/my_work.html">here.</a> <br>
		Passionate linux user, who mostly uses it because windows is going in a very user hostile direction and does not want to learn the mac hotkeys. <br>
		Most of the problems I have had to solve working on my projects often do not have an answer online. <br>
		I often add little secrets for those who hunt them down.
